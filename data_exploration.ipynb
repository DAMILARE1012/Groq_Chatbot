If I do not have sex for days, they become sensitive. I was treated with Ceftum 500 mg, the first time I had an infection.

You can take anti-inflammatory medicines like Ibuprofen for symptomatic relief.4) Doing cool compresses over the scrotal area will help in reducing the inflammation and pain.'}"

Both you and your husband should wait until the drug has completely cleared from your systems before trying to conceive. \\\\n\\\\nCocaine and its metabolites can be detected in urine for up to 72 hours after use, but it can take longer for the drug to clear from the system completely. The length of time it takes for cocaine to clear from the system can vary depending on factors such as the amount used, frequency of use, and individual metabolism.\\\\n\\\\nRegarding your question about cocain in sperm, cocaine can be present in seminal fluid up to 48 hours after use. \\\\n\\\\nI would highly recommend seeking medical advice from a healthcare professional who can provide you and your husband with personalized recommendations based on your individual health histories, usage patterns, and a full medical evaluation.',\n",
       " 'answer_chatdoctor': '1) Cocaine use can affect fertility by causing male infertility due to decreased sperm motility and morphology as well as increased abnormal semen parameters (especially pH). However, there is insufficient evidence to suggest that cocaine causes significant changes in female fertility.2) It is not clear how long cocaine remains in semen or blood after use. Therefore, it is difficult to say exactly when it will be completely gone from your husbands body.3) There is no data regarding the amount of time that couples need to abstain from sexual activity before attempting conception.4) In conclusion, if you want to become pregnant, then you should avoid coke for at least three months before trying to conceive. Hope this helps'}"
