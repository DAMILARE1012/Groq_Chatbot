Tooth discoloration (especially in children) 8. Inhibition of bone growth (in children and adolescents) Rare but serious side effects: 1. Anaphylaxis (severe allergic reaction) 2. Stevens-Johnson syndrome (a severe skin and mucous membrane disorder) 3. Toxic epidermal necrolysis (a life-threatening skin condition) 4. Hepatic failure (liver failure) 5. Renal failure (kidney failure) 6. Pseudotumor cerebri (increased pressure in the brain) 7. Blood disorders (e.g., anemia, thrombocytopenia) Special considerations: 1. Tetracyclines can interact with other medications, such as blood thinners, and decrease their effectiveness. 2. They can also increase the risk of sunburn and skin cancer when taken with certain medications or exposed to UV radiation. 3. Tetracyclines are generally not recommended during pregnancy or breastfeeding, as they can affect fetal development or infant growth. 4. Children under 8 years old should not take tetracyclines, as they can cause permanent tooth discoloration. It's essential to consult your healthcare provider or pharmacist if you experience any side effects or have concerns about taking a tetracycline antibiotic. They can help you weigh the benefits and risks of treatment and provide guidance on managing potential side effects.\",\n",

      "        \"Question\": \"Can a medication used to treat Acne cause vision or hearing problems?\",\n",
      "        \"LLM Answer\": \"Yes, some medications used to treat acne can potentially cause vision or hearing problems, although this is rare. Here are some examples: Vision problems: 1. Isotretinoin (Accutane): This oral retinoid is commonly used to treat severe acne. It can cause eye problems such as dry eyes, blurred vision, and increased sensitivity to light. In rare cases, it may also cause more serious eye issues like cataracts, glaucoma, or even permanent vision loss. 2. Tetracyclines (e.g., doxycycline, minocycline): These antibiotics are often used to treat acne. They can cause blurred vision, double vision, or sensitivity to light. In rare cases, they may also cause more serious eye problems like papilledema (swelling of the optic disc). 3. Hormonal therapies (e.g., spironolactone): These medications can cause changes in vision, including blurred vision or double vision, in some individuals. Hearing problems: 1. Minocycline: This antibiotic has been associated with hearing loss, tinnitus (ringing in the ears), or vertigo (dizziness) in rare cases. 2. Isotretinoin (Accutane): Although rare, isotretinoin has been linked to hearing loss, tinnitus, or vertigo in some individuals. 3. Doxycycline: This antibiotic may cause tinnitus or hearing loss in rare cases. Important notes: * These side effects are rare and usually reversible once the medication is stopped. * If you experience any vision or hearing problems while taking acne medication, contact your doctor or dermatologist immediately. * Regular monitoring and follow-up appointments with your doctor can help identify any potential issues early on. * It's essential to weigh the benefits and risks of any medication with your doctor before starting treatment. Remember, it's crucial to discuss any concerns or questions you have with your doctor or dermatologist before starting or continuing any acne treatment. They can help you make informed decisions about your treatment and monitor you for any potential side effects.\",\n",
